## What did I implement in this project

### user stories:
<ul>
  <li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
  <li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
  <li>Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats</li>
</ul>

### based on above user stories I implemented following features
- User can view the layout on different screen size's
- User can see states of hover 
- User can switch between daily, weekly, and monethly stats.


## Lessons Learned

- Css grid is amazing, using grids and flex box together can reduce the media quaries.
- Grids are mainly used for 2D layout and flex-box is used for 1D layout (column or row).
- Learned some css functions like minmax() and repeat().
